    <h1>Red Velvet Cake</h1>
    <p>Okay I am SO EXCITED to finally be sharing my red velvet cake recipe! This red velvet cake is so incredibly soft, full of flavor and is topped with the most delicious cream cheese buttercream. It has a super velvety texture and slightly tart, yet sweet and creamy frosting â€“ making it the best red velvet cake recipe Iâ€™ve tried!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2Â¼ cups (275 g) flour - regular all purpose (see note 3 if you want to use cake flour)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp (18 g) cornflour - also known as cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tbsp (14 g) cocoa powder - unsweetened</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp salt - omit if using salted butter</li>
        <li>6 tbsp (86 g) unsalted butter - room temperature</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup (141 g) unflavoured vegetable oil - I use canola</li>
        <li>1Â¾ cups (344 g) white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs - room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (12 g) vanilla essence/extract</li>
        <li>1Â½ tsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>3Â½ tbsp (38 g) red liquid food colouring</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup (158 g) buttermilk - room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 160 Â°C (320Â°F) with the fan on (see note 7 if you don't have a fan function) and grease and/or line two 8 inch cake tins (I use my homemade cake release).
        <li>In a bowl, sift together your flour, cornflour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Using a whisk or fork, mix until well combined. Set aside.
        <li>In another bowl, add in your butter, vegetable oil and sugar. Using an electric mixer (hand or stand mixer are both fine - see note 6), cream together for 2-3 minutes until light and creamy.
        <li>Add in eggs one by one, mixing well in between each addition (about 10-15 seconds between eggs).</li>
        <li>Add in your vanilla, vinegar and red liquid food colour, and mix until well combined. Now set your mixer aside as the remainder of the batter will be finished by hand. </li>
        <li>Finish off by adding in half of your premixed dry ingredients to your wet mixture, and gently fold it in with a spatula until just combined. Then add in all of your buttermilk, and fold it in until just combined. Lastly, add in the remaining dry ingredients and gently fold it into the mixture until just combined. Do not overmix (see note 1).</li>
        <li>Distribute the batter evenly into the two 8 inch cake tins, and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Be careful not to open the oven door too early otherwise this can cause the cake layers to sink (see note 2). Also avoid overbaking the cake layers otherwise they will dry out.</li>
        <li>Once baked, allow them to cool in the cake tins for about 15-20 minutes, and then turn them out onto a wire rack to completely cool before frosting with my cream cheese buttercream frosting.
